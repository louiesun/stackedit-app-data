Assuming that the Student Development Center allows writing to off-campus but does not allow writing to your boyfriend and girlfriend, then they will review the address and recipient of your letter and have the doorman discard the relevant letter directly.
同样地，即使现代技术可以通过非对称加密保护你信件的内容，目前一般无法加密IP地址也就是收货地址，以及域名也就是收件人。因此访问特定地址或者特定网站可能被阻断。
Similarly, even if modern technology can protect the content of your letters through asymmetric encryption, it is generally impossible to encrypt the IP address, that is, the delivery address, and the domain name, the recipient. Therefore, access to a specific address or a specific website may be blocked.
即使“爱情的力量是伟大的”，但你具体能怎么做呢？一个思路是第三方转发。比方说你给某社会人士写了一封信，内容类似于：将此信之后内容转发某校某班某某。这样做你们两个就交流成功了。其实这就类似Vlirtua rivate etwor和中间人建立通信，中间人再和你同学建立通信。
Even if "the power of love is great", what can you do specifically? One idea is third-party forwarding. For example, you wrote a letter to a person in a society, and the content is similar to: forward the content of this letter to a certain class in a certain school. Doing this way, you two will be able to communicate successfully. In fact, this is similar to Virtual Private Network. You establish communication with the middleman, and the middleman then establish communication with your classmates.
回到一开始的问题，这里的信道到底是什么？我搜到的百科的定义是：“以传输媒介为基础的信号通道”。

你的信件其实永远是经过门卫的，还是走的那一套邮政系统。正如你的访问其实还是走的中国电信，中国移动，中国联通三者之一提供的有线或者无线网络， 然后经过上海国际出口发往国外。你并没有私拉光缆直接连向日本或者使用卫星通讯，而且你也没这个钱。

最后，我只能说：法律面前，你没有解释权。

People often claim that "翻墙（climbing over the wall）" is illegal. In reality, the sole relevant legal provision can be found
People often claim that "climbing over the wall" is illegal. The sole relevant law is in the "Interim Provisions on the Management of International Networking of Computer Information Networks of the People's Republic of China," which states": "No entity or individual shall establish or utilize anyse other channels for international networking without proper authorization."
The question lies in what exactly the "channel" here refers to, and there is
  

The key question is what the "channel" means, with no explanation in the document. To further discuss this topic, let's first take a look at the general process of accessing the international Internet. To make it more vivid and accessible, I've decided to drawI'll use an analogy with: writing a letter to a junior high school classmate fromin another school.Suppose t The Student Development Center permits writing letters to thoseallows letters outside the school, yet prohibits sending letters to your significant others. In such a situation, they will check the recipient's but not to significant others. They check addresses and name on your letter, and the doorman will simply discard the relevant correspondence.s and discard related letters.

  

Similarly, althoughwhile modern technology enables the protection of your can protect letter's content via asymmetric encryption, in general, it is currently infeat's usually impossible to encrypt the IP address, which is analogous to (like the delivery address,) and the domain name, akin to (like the recipient's identity). ThereforeSo, accessing a specific addresses or a particular websites may be blocked.Even though it's said that "the power of love is great", what on earth can you actually do? One idea is to use a

  

Even with "the power of love", what can you do? One option is third-party forwarding service. For example, you write a letter to a certain person in society, and the content is something like: Forward the following content of this letter to someone in a certain class of a certain school. In this way, you and the other person can successfully communicate. In fact, this is similar to a Virtual Private Network (commonly abbreviated as VPN). You establishto someone asking them to forward a message to a classmate. This is like a VPN, where you communicatione with an intermediary, and then the intermediary establishes communication with who then contacts your classmate.Going b

  

Back to the initial question, what exactly i's the channel here? The definition I found in the? An encyclopedia is:defines it as "Aa signal path based on a transmission medium." In fact, your letter always goes through the doorman and still uses the samthe postal system. Just as your Internet access still goes through the wired or wireless network provided by one of the three major telecom operators in China, namelyuses networks from China Telecom, China Mobile, or China Unicom, and then is sent abroad throughgoes abroad via the Shanghai International Gateway. You docan't lay a private optical cable directly to Japancable or use satellite communication, and you don't have the money to do so either.In the end, I can only state that when it comes tolikely can't afford it either.

  

In short, regarding the law, you have no authority to interpret it.
